Android Build Instructions

Build container image. This has been tested to work using podman, e.g.:

podman build -t gphoto-android-dev .

Run container image, passing in host volume mounts for workspace directory to hold sources and build artifacts, e.g.:

podman run --interactive --tty --rm \
	-v /my-workspace:/workspace \
	gphoto-android-dev:latest

The default command will build libgphoto2, gphoto2 and dependencies. There are also other scripts under /script that build individual projects. You can append "/bin/bash" to the end of the podman command to get a shell in the build environment.

The command will automatically download and build dependencies such as libtool, libusb, and libpopt. If source directories for the dependencies already exist in the build directory, they will not be redownloaded. One caveat is currently, the script downloads the default branch of the dependency's git repo. If breaking changes occur in that branch, there may be incompatibilities/build breakages.


How to use:

After compiling, build artifacts will appear in /workspace/_prefix. You will then need to get them onto your phone. One way is to tar them, copy them onto your phone, and then use adb shell to untar them. At least on my phone, /data/local/tmp doesn't require root to write to. However, to actually run the gphoto2 program, you may need root for USB access. PTP/IP over WiFi should be okay without root if your camera supports it. It might be possible to package everything in an APK along with a Java Android app that extracts them to the app's directory in /data and invokes gphoto2, but I haven't tried that yet, and that doesn't get past the root requirement.

To run gphoto2, you'll have to set the CAMLIBS, IOLIBS, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables to point to the directories in /data where you have the binaries. For example, if you were in a root adb shell:

cd /data/local/tmp/_prefix/bin/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/local/tmp/_prefix/lib
export CAMLIBS=/data/local/tmp/_prefix/lib/libgphoto2/2.5.26.1/
export IOLIBS=/data/local/tmp/_prefix/lib/libgphoto2_port/0.12.0/
./gphoto2 --shell


Limitations:

* The Android NDK compiler treats __VA_ARGS__ differently from gcc, causing an off-by-one bug in the ptp2 driver. If you use ptp2, try incorporating this commit: https://github.com/fahrion2600/libgphoto2/commit/914553d71f02515b3c12acdca760aef2c92d0591

* Unless you have a rooted Android phone, you will not be able to connect to cameras via USB due to the Android security model. Changes are required in libgphoto2 to make it work, as well as a Java Android app to handle the USB permissions properly. PTP/IP via WiFi should work, as well as USB using root.

* Currently, not all libgphoto2/gphoto2 dependencies are encapsulated, just the bare minimum.
